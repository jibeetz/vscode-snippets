	// Place your snippets for ruby here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "zzz",
		"body": [
			"binding.pry"
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	},
	"Puts": {
		"prefix": "qqq",
		"body": [
			"puts '-------' \nputs 'desc: $1' \nputs $2 \nputs '-------'"
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	}
}
